# OPM_Galileo v1.2.5
_This is a version of OPM maintained by Galileo_
This version of Outer Planets Mod is for KSP version 1.3.1, compatible with Kopernicus before and after 1.3.1-4

### Change log
* Added Kopernicus asteroids
* Resources for Far Future Technologies
* Fixed MM syntax for science definitions
* Fixed Nissee localization error
* No longer includes MM dll
* OPM's Planetshine deactivates if GPP is present. Evidently Planetshine doesn't work well or at all for planets orbiting stars other than Sun.

* Arranged Optional Mods folder: contains FinalFrontier support
* Rearranged and converted textures for better use of LoadOnDemand
* Removed a file that was breaking OPM's FinalFrontier support
