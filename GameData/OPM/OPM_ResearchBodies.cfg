		Hale = Hidden in Sarnus' majestic rings we've discovered a very small moon. Since it shepherds the rings around it, we should name it after the mythological shepherd Hale.
		Ovok = At the outer edge of Sarnus' rings we see a small moon with an unusual shape. It is only fitting that we name it after Ovok, the beast that guarded the gates of the Underworld of the old myths.
		*Eeloo = At first it look like this dot was a planet beyond Sarnus' orbit. On closer inspection it turns out to be a moon of Sarnus. Eeloo sounds like a good name for it.
		Slate = A large moon orbiting Sarnus was spotted on our telescopes. Dark areas are visible on the satellite that remind you of the color of Slate. Yeah, Slate will be a good name for this moon.
		Tekto = After thinking for some while that there was a booger on the telescope, we realized it was actually a moon orbiting Sarnus. For some reason 
		Urlum = For centuries we didn't think there were any more planets out beyond Sarnus. Turns out we were wrong. Naturally we'll name this sky blue dot in the darkness of space after the old deity of the heavens, Urlum.
		Polta = We found a moon around Urlum with ice cream-like coloring sort of like Minmus. We think it should be called Polta, after our team's favorite ice cream brand. It's the right thing to do.
		Priax = At first we thought we were seeing the moon Polta in two places at once, but it turns out there's a small moon that shares the same orbit as Polta. We'll name this brave little moon after Priax, the hero of legend.
		Wal = We've spotted a walnut-shaped moon around Urlum. No-one is feeling very inspired today, so we'll just call it Wal.
		Tal = We didn't think it was possible, but there seems to be a moon orbiting Wal, which is itself a moon of Urlum. Let's name it Tal, after it's big companion Wal.
		Neidon = Mathematicians predicted that there should be another planet beyond Urlum's orbit and we just found it on our telescopes. It's purple like Eve. Maybe name it after Neidon, the companion of the mythological Eve?
		Thatmo = We previously thought it to be an UFO, because of its strange retrograde orbit, but it proved to be an actual moon of Neidon. We're quite partial to the name Thatmo.
		Nissee = After squinting hard at very small dots for what seems like months, we discovered a small moon orbiting Neidon at a considerable distance. 
		Plock = That faint brown dot in the sky turns out not to be some star, but an actual planet far, far away from Kerbin. Let's name it Plock, after the mythological deity that guarded the ends of the world.
		Karen = The dwarf planet Plock seems to have a moon, but they're dancing around each other like no other pair of bodies in the system. Perhaps we should name this body after the popular dancer Karen Kerman?
