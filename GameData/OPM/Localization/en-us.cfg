		//Nissee
		#LOC_OPM_Nissee_displayName = Nissee^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Neidon_description = A small moon in a highly inclined and eccentric orbit around Neidon. Its surface looks strangely similar to marble. As a result it has become the envy of every sculptor on Kerbin.

		//Thatmo
		#LOC_OPM_Thatmo_displayName = Thatmo^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Thatmo_description = This icy moon was found to have a very thin atmosphere, just thick enough to support aerodynamic flight. It has been the number one destination on every daredevil aviator's bucket list ever since. Oh, and it rotates in the opposite direction around its planet as every other moon. Quite the strange moon indeed.

		//Neidon
		#LOC_OPM_Neidon_displayName = Neidon^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Neidon_description = Due to its distance from Kerbin, it wasn't until fairly recently that Kerbalkind discovered the Kerbol system's most distant planet. At first scientists thought Neidon might be a purple, rocky planet like Eve, but they quickly realized they were in fact looking at an ice giant similar to Urlum.

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_EquatorialZonesDisplayName = Equatorial Zones
		//Plock
		#LOC_OPM_Plock_displayName = Plock^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Plock_description = There’s been a considerable amount of controversy  concerning the status of Plock as being a proper planet or just a lump of ice going around the Sun. The debate is still ongoing, as most academic summits held to address the issue have devolved into, on good days, petty name calling, and on worse ones, all-out brawls.

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_NexisRegionDisplayName = Nexis Region
		//Sarnus
		#LOC_OPM_Sarnus_displayName = Sarnus^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Sarnus_description = Early astronomers believed Sarnus was in fact multiple planets, closely orbiting together. When they cleaned their telescopes, they realized that those extra planets were in fact thin rings orbiting Sarnus. Regular cleaning of telescope lenses became mandatory after that.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_PolarHexagonDisplayName = Polar Hexagon

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_GreatWhiteSpotDisplayName = Great White Spot
		//Urlum
		#LOC_OPM_Urlum_displayName = Urlum^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Urlum_description = It took a while for Kerbal astronomers to realize Urlum was not a far away star, but in fact another planet. Since then scientists have been weary of making claims about Urlum, for fear of being wrong yet again. The ice giant is unusual in that it rotates around its axis in a clockwise fashion, unlike the anti-clockwise rotation of the other planets.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_PolarZonesDisplayName = Polar Zones

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_EquatorialZoneDisplayName = Equatorial Zone
		//Karen
		#LOC_OPM_Karen_displayName = Karen^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Karen_description = Karen is a moon of Plock, but at the same time it also kind of isn't. Due to their relative masses, the two bodies dance around each other in a way that is like no other two bodies in the solar system.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_SlekonBasinDisplayName = Slekon Basin

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_ArralakhValleyDisplayName = Arralakh Valley
		//Hale
		#LOC_OPM_Hale_displayName = Hale^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Hale_description = This small moonlet orbiting in the rings of Sarnus is named after Hale, a female shepherd from Kerbal mythology who saved the galaxy from certain destruction. Its location in Sarnus' rings results in some of the finest views in the Kerbol system.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_MaculaDisplayName = Macula
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_AmariusRegionDisplayName = Amarius Region
		//Ovok
		#LOC_OPM_Ovok_displayName = Ovok^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Ovok_description = Ovok's characteristic smooth egg shape is caused by the tidal force exerted by Sarnus and Ovok's gravity. This has led scientists to believe that the moon must consist of an icy fluff, that easily contracts and expands, resulting in a landscape that is free of deep impact craters. The moon was named for Ovok, a mythological beast known for its soft fur and razor-like claws.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_MaculaOblongataDisplayName = Macula Oblongata
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_TasiRegionDisplayName = Tasi Region
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_ScarringDisplayName = Scarring
		//Slate
		#LOC_OPM_Slate_displayName = Slate^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Slate_description = Evidence suggests that Slate had an atmosphere only a few million years ago, until an unknown cataclysm stripped the atmosphere away, leaving only a dry husk behind. It's yellow and brown colors have inspired many painters since it's discovery, including the renowned Vincent Van Kerman.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_MountNehelenniaDisplayName = Mount Nehelennia

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_OrodruinChaosDisplayName = Orodruin Chaos
		//Tekto
		#LOC_OPM_Tekto_displayName = Tekto^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Tekto_description = This moon has a very dense atmosphere for a body its size. Combined with the low gravity, this means that a Kerbal with wings attached to his arms could lift off from the surface of the moon under his or her own power. Those wings would have to be made of some sturdy materials though, as Tekto's atmosphere appears to be very violent.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_GeomagneticAnomalyDisplayName = Geomagnetic Anomaly

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_SiliskoSeaDisplayName = Silisko Sea
		//Polta
		#LOC_OPM_Polta_displayName = Polta^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Polta_description = Polta's mint-colored appearance immediately reminded astronomers of Minmus, but it was quickly realized that that was still in orbit of Kerbin and this thus had to be another body. Polta's surface is made of smooth and swirling terrain forms, most likely a result of tidal heating caused by the nearby Urlum.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_NockmaarFoothillsDisplayName = Nockmaar Foothills
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_ZuevHillsDisplayName = Zuev Hills
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_SubotaiHillsDisplayName = Subotai Hills

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_JarethLabyrinthDisplayName = Jareth Labyrinth
		//Priax
		#LOC_OPM_Priax_displayName = Priax^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Priax_description = Priax shares the orbit of its larger cousin Polta, making it a co-orbital configuration. This strange orbit is stable because Priax is located in the libration point of the larger Polta. Priax is also characterized by its heavily cratered surface, which makes it sort of resemble lump of cheese. Whether the surface is edible has yet to be confirmed.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_BadieRegionDisplayName = Badie Region

		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_CraterChainsDisplayName = Crater Chains
		//Tal
		#LOC_OPM_Tal_displayName = Tal^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Tal_description = Tal is what astronomer's call a sub-satellite. While generally these moons of moons are impossible due to too small spheres of influence, Wal's distant orbit from the ice giant Urlum allowed Tal to maintain a stable orbit. Tal's albedo indicates it is composed of metals, ice or both.
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_DunranaRegionDisplayName = Dunrana Region
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_SigleyRegionDisplayName = Sigley Region
		//Wal
		#LOC_OPM_Wal_displayName = Wal^N
		#LOC_OPM_Planets_Wal_description = Wal is instantly recognizable due to its walnut-like shape. Its multi-colored surface has led to it winning the title 'Most Beautiful Moon of the Year' two years in a row. Its distinctive equatorial ridge is likely to be caused by the tidal forces created by  Wal's moon Tal.

		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SlateSrfLandedNorthernIslands = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin’s beaches, but it’s less dense and darker in color.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SlateSrfLandedKowganArchipelago = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin’s beaches, but it’s less dense and darker in color.

		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_TektoSrfLandedWitvoogdPeninsula = The sample you picked up mostly consists of multi-colored sand.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_TektoSrfLandedPozineRegion = This unusual green soil definitely needs to be investigated thoroughly.

		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PoltaSrfLandedFalkorPlains = Mixed in with the rock is water ice, which contains trace amounts of carbon dioxide and methane. Interesting!
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PoltaSrfLandedSalcedoPlains = You stare up at the stars, wondering, why you are here on this rock. Then you realize you're here to drill, baby!
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PoltaSrfLandedArsonidePlains = Mixed in with the rock is water ice, which contains trace amounts of carbon dioxide and methane. Interesting!
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PoltaSrfLandedEidillegValley = The sample resembles ice cream. You have to fight every fiber in your body to not take of your helmet and lick the sample.

		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PoltaSrfLandedJarethLabyrinth = You find traces of elements found nowhere else nearby. No doubt some of these depressions were caused by asteroid impacts, even if the crater is no longer clearly visible.

		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PriaxSrfLandedBadieRegion = The regolith sample is very fine-grained, no doubt a result of constant impacts with asteroids coming across Priax' orbital path.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PriaxSrfLandedBadieRegion = You were expecting rock, but got mostly ice. Another day, another disappointment.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = The material from this crater is lighter than other parts of the moon because it has not yet been darkened by centuries of bombardment by solar rays, indicating the crater is relatively recent.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = The ammonia crystals feel crunchy as you pick them up.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PriaxSrfLandedSidoRegion = This moon is most certainly not made of cheese. After Minmus and now this, you are uncertain as to whether any snacks can be found on other worlds.
		#LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_PriaxSrfLandedSidoRegion = You attempt to cut a slice of Priax out of the surface to pair with the crackers inside the spacecraft, but you only get a crumbly icy slab.
